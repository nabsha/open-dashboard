My wife have opted to choose the humanoids development stages as my release milestones. I am not sure how far will this go, but it made more sense then to name animals... Actually, each of them have some deterministic features so I will use them accordingly in future releases(hopefully)

# Milestones #

  1. PreNatal
  1. NewBorn
  1. Infant
  1. Toddler
  1. Pubert
  1. Young Adult (This is the point after which I will start the whole numbers :))
